<thinking>
The user just sent "a" - a single letter. This is likely a casual/test message. Let me check if any skills apply.

Looking at the skills list, the "conversation-logger" skill says: "Use when user shares thoughts, ideas, experiences, opinions, or stories during conversation that are not explicit task requests. Triggers on casual talk, brainstorming, venting, observations, reflections, or any personal narrative."

A single letter "a" is barely a message - it's more of a test/ping than a thought or story. I don't think conversation-logger applies here.

No other skill seems relevant either. I'll just respond concisely.

Hey! How can I help?
